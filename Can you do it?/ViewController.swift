I am sure you can do it, but if it is overwhelming go back to level three so you can improve with that first. When you believe you are ready go to level 5, which is basically just a little more advanced than this currrent level you are in."

This level is for you if you believe that no matter how many tasks you have you can complete them productively without getting distracted. I am so happy you have gotten to this level, but don't overstresss and if it is too hard then go back to level four, which is also very good. If that isn't the case then, Nice You Have Reached the Highest and Hardest Level here."
